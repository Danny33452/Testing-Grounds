// I once wrote a program that wouldn't compile
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
//
// My program did nothing
// So I started typing.
// I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
//
// "Parse error," cried the compiler
// Luckily I'm such a code baller.
// I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
// I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
//
// Now the compiler wanted an identifier
// And I thought the situation was getting dire.
// I added a main method with its String[] args,
// I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
// I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
//
// Java complained it expected an enum
// Boy, these computers really are dumb!
// I added a public class and called it Scum,
// I added a main method with its String[] args,
// I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
// I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
//
// Like a dog following a command,
// Check out the name of the method
// To retrieve me my final verse.
// I added a public class and called it Scum,
// I added a main method with its String[] args,
// I added a backslash to escape the quotes,
// I added System.out.println("I <3 coding"),
// I don't know why it wouldn't compile,
// My teacher just smiled.
